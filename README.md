# Github_Finder

This is a unique project allowing the user to find Github Users using their user name. I have registered this project on github (OAuth Apps) so, as to access more than 100 requests from its REST Api

I used a github classe and a ui class so, as to implement Es6 classes.
When i get into Es6 modules, which aren't supported in the bowser yet, i'll have to use something like the webpacks along with babble to transpile your code, to be able to have modulor file; moduler js will actually be able to include 1 js file into another. And i'll be implementing that later on.

Moreover, for this project i'll be using Bootswatch cdn
